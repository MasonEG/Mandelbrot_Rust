#My attempt at graphing the mandelbrot set in Rust
I wanted to do this for a while and am fairly satisfied with the result. The ranges for the colors aren't
perfect and you can see that in the lines that don't have smooth color transitions. Any code I stole came
from https://github.com/image-rs/image/blob/master/examples/fractal.rs.
